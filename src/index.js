          This is an example project of how to test react components
          using react-testing-library and Jest. The idea is that most
          of the tests should be runnable in codesandbox to make it
          easy to try things out, fork, contribute, etc. However,
          there will be some tests which do not work in codesandbox
          and we'll put those in a special folder called __local_tests__.
